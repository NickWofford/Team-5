**Introduction**

Data Summary

sales data includes data on the types of liquor, the quantities sold, the prices, the stores where the sales were made, and the dates of the sales.

The dates of sales, for example, can be helpful for identifying trends in liquor sales over time. What's more, it also reveals certain seasonal variations or other fluctuations that could rich our analysis. Data on different types of liquor and stores, on the other hand, is useful for identifying patterns in sales based on location or product type.

Here I emphasized on exploring the ranking of different categories of liquor sold in each demographics. It's interesting to see the how sales pattern follow a similar pattern across different demographics.

Here is the aggregated sales data from different cities within Iowa state. We see from the pie chart how Whisky and Vodka take up more than half the entire sales, with 61% of sales in total!

The city ranking chart further proves that. We see clearly how the first two categories representing Whisky and Vodka sales have much longer bars than the rest categories.

The city dynamic ranking on the left is a bit messy to look at, but one interesting finding is how city named Des Moines take down most sales in almost every category of liquor except Distilled Spirits(sold most in Mount Vernon instead). Cedar Rapids and Davenport gets a close chase after Des Moines in terms of aggregated sales.

Next we could conduct a similar research using the county data instead. Below is a reprint of the results we have.

Narrowing down the demographics scale to county doesn't change the fact that Whisky and Vodka are still two most popular categories. Again, pie chart and county ranking reflect many empirical evidence of liquor sales.

The county ranking dynamics seem comparatively neater than the city one, indicating how there is less disparity in terms of liquor categories sold in each county, which makes sense because narrower region usually reduce the possibility of liquor variations.

Let's now take a look at the zip code data.

Skipping the zip code ranking and pie chart which conform with the previous analysis on city and county, let's head straight into analyzing the ranking dynamics. Surprisingly the ranking dynamics didn't show an even neater pattern as we'd expected for a even narrower region. One possible explanation for this may be due to the fact that data relating to zip code is too detailed and detached, thus hard to follow a pattern out of it. Think of a county consisting of 15 zip codes, zip codes that are in older neighborhood or near campus would yield very different sales data among liquor categories, thus there hardly is any pattern in terms of zip code preference.
