## Team 5 Course Project

**Checkpoint 1**

Team 5 has established a Git repository for our project and established
a cadence of working sessions to collaborate on our individual tasks. So
far, we’ve divided the three pieces of analysis (on the sales data, ACS
data, and the merged dataset of the two) among ourselves. 
Specifically, Jin Yan would conduct analysis on the aggregated sales data; 
Liuyi Yang will visualize and analyze on the ACS data, and Nick would be responsible for merging the two data sets and conduct future analysis. 
We also established our preference to use Tableau for the analysis and
visualization. For the new ACS data sets, we understood the connections across different files and decided to conduct analyses on three individual workbooks based on the unique variables of geographical traits on Tableau. 

Then, we’ll synchronize our efforts into a coherent
format that helps understand the data, as well as our team’s research
question:

- Are there any preference patterns for liquor consumption among
  different races? What are most popular liquor categories among
  geographies with highest share of minorities?

Getting our Git repository set up was a learning experience, as we had
not used it extensively before now. I think a huge victory for us was
when all three of us were able to pull the cloned repository to our
local machines, and can now begin on the work itself.
